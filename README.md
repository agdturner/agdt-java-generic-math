# math
## Description
A Java library for decimal arithmetic. It has no third party library dependencies and depends only of the developers generic library.
  - The highlights are:
    - Math_BigDecimal that has generally useful BigDecimal arithmetic.
    - Math_BigInteger that has generally useful BigInteger arithmetic.
## Current Version
This is essentially research software, but an attempt is being made to standardise the software development and evolve it following the principles of software carpentry advocated by the Software Sustainability Institute (https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes-events/carpentries/software-carpentry).
The currently version of the library is Version 1.0-Snapshot. This is essentially still working towards a version 1.0.0 release.
The library should work with Java 8 or higher.
## Development Roadmap
The Roadmap for the development of Version 1.0.0 of the library is as follows.
- For 1.0.0
  - The code base will be reviewed:
      - The names of variables and methods will be reviewed to simplify and standardise the code.
      - Additional Unit Tests may be written for untested methods.
      - Documentation will be reviewed and updated.
