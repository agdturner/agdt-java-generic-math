# agdt-java-generic-math

## Description
A Java library for numerical data processing. The library depends only on an identically licensed generic library available via (https://github.com/agdturner/agdt-java-generic). It provides BigDecimal and BigInteger arithmetic functionality that allow the user to specify the accuracy and precision of results. It also provides some functionality for processing complex numbers.

## Current Version
This research software is progressing towards a stable version 1.0.0 release. The current version of the library is Version 1.0-Snapshot.
### Requirements
Java 8 or higher.
### Dependencies
agdt-java-generic available via https://github.com/agdturner/agdt-java-generic which itself depends only on Java 8 or higher.

## Development Roadmap
An attempt is being made to follow the principles of software carpentry advocated by the Software Sustainability Institute (https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes-events/carpentries/software-carpentry).

The Roadmap for the development of Version 1.0.0 of the library scheduled for 2020 is as follows.
- Review and standardise variable names.
- Review and develop Unit Tests as appropriate.
- Review and update documentation as approriate.
