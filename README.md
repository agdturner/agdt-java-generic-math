# math
## Description
A Java library for decimal arithmetic. It has no third party library dependencies and depends only of the developers generic library.
  - The highlights are:
    - Math_BigDecimal that has generally useful BigDecimal arithmetic.
    - Math_BigInteger that has generally useful BigInteger arithmetic.
## Current Version
This is essentially research software, but an attempt is being made to standardise the software development and evolve it following the principles of software carpentry advocated by the Software Sustainability Institute (https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes-events/carpentries/software-carpentry).
Currently the version of the library is known as Version 1.0-Snapshot. This is essentially still working towards a version 1.0.0 release.
The library should run on Java 8 or higher.
## Development Roadmap
The Roadmap for the development of Version 1.0.0 of the library is as follows. The code review is expected to be completed in early 2019:
- For 1.0.0
  - The code base will be reviewed:
      - The names of classes and variables will be reviewed to consider standardising them.
      - Tests will be written for untested methods.
      - Documentation will be reviewed.
  - Subsequently, a timeline for delivering Version 1.0.0 will be updated and the refactoring process will begin.
